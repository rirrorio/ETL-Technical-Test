      <h2 style="text-align: center">What is a Mechanical Keyboard?</h2>
      <p>
        The technology of computer keyboards includes many elements. Among the
        more important of these is the switch technology that they use. Computer
        alphanumeric keyboards typically have 80 to 110 durable switches,
        generally one for each key. The choice of switch technology affects key
        response (the positive feedback that a key has been pressed) and
        pre-travel (the distance needed to push the key to enter a character
        reliably). Virtual keyboards on touch screens have no physical switches
        and provide audio and haptic feedback instead. Some newer keyboard
        models use hybrids of various technologies to achieve greater cost
        savings or better ergonomics. The modern keyboard also includes a
        control processor and indicator lights to provide feedback to the user
        (and to the central processor) about what state the keyboard is in. Plug
        and play technology means that its 'out of the box' layout can be
        notified to the system, making the keyboard immediately ready to use
        without need for further configuration unless the user so desires.

      <p>
        Every key on a mechanical-switch keyboard contains a complete switch
        underneath. Each switch is composed of a housing, a spring, and a stem,
        and sometimes other parts such as a separate tactile leaf or a clickbar.
        Switches come in three variants: "linear" with consistent resistance,
        "tactile" with a non-audible bump, and "clicky" with both a bump and an
        audible click. Depending on the resistance of the spring, the key
        requires different amounts of pressure to actuate and to bottom out. The
        shape of the stem as well as the design of the switch housing varies the
        actuation distance and travel distance of the switch. The sound can be
        altered by the material of the plate, case, lubrication, the keycap
        profile, and even modifying the individual switch. These modifications,
        or "mods" include applying lubricant to reduce friction inside the
        switch itself, inserting "switch films" to reduce wobble, swapping out
        the spring inside to modify the resistance of the switch itself and many
        more. Mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of
        keycaps with a common stem type. Alongside the mechanical keyboard
        switch is the stabilizer, which supports longer keys such as the
        "spacebar", "enter", "backspace", and "shift" keys. Although these are
        not as diverse as switches, they come in different sizes. These
        different sizes are designed for keyboards that are longer than normal.
        Similar to a mechanical keyboard switch, the stabilizer can be modified
        to alter the sound and feel of these certain keys. Lubricant can be used
        to reduce the rattle of the metal wire that makes up a stabilizer.
        Furthermore, implementing padding in the "housing" of the stabilizer
        will lessen rattle and improve acoustics. Mechanical keyboards typically
        have a longer lifespan than membrane or dome-switch keyboards.tation
        needed] A major producer of mechanical switches is Cherry, who has
        manufactured the MX family of switches since the 1980s. Cherry's
        color-coding system of categorizing switches has been imitated by other
        mechanical switch manufacturers, such as Gateron and Kailh among many
        others.

        Now, enough wikipedia. Regarding mechanical keyboard switch, it's not
        the old days anymore where when you want to buy or build a keyboard and
        the only switch that comes to mind come from cherry. I'm not saying that
        cherry switches are bad, but the grass is (or atleast it can be) always
        greener on the other side, right ? Enough said, here are our switch
        recommendation:
